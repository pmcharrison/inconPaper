# inconPaper

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.2546043.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2546043)

This repository, `inconPaper`, 
contains the analysis scripts for 
Peter M. C. Harrison & Marcus T. Pearce's manuscript
"Instantaneous consonance in the perception and composition of Western music".

## Folders

- `input` - Contains some of the input data used for the analyses.
- `output` - All output files are written to this folder.
- `R` - Contains the source code for the analyses

## Dependencies

The R scripts depend on several common open-source R packages,
which can be installed using the following commands in R
(internet connection required):

```r
install.packages(c(
  "tidyverse", "boot", "memoise", "purrrlyr", "glue", "broom", "zeallot", 
  "withr", "jsonlite", "plyr", "cowplot", "AICcmodavg", "margins",
  "prediction", "cocor", "R.utils", "devtools"
))
devtools::install_github(paste("pmcharrison/", c(
  "hrep", "incon", "inconData", "voicer"
), sep = ""))
```

We also used version 2.1 of Essentia and version 1.6.1 of MIRtoolbox.
For the former, it is necessary to install a Docker image for Essentia
(https://hub.docker.com/r/mtgupf/essentia/).

## Running

The main scripts are to be run within R.
Each script can be run in a fresh R session.

- `R/1-model-perception/1-compile/1-compile.R` (re)compiles the perceptual data,
saving results to the `output` folder.
- `R/1-model-perception/2-analyse/analyse.R` runs the perceptual analyses,
using compiled data present in the `output` folder,
and saves final outputs including figures.
- `R/2-model-composition/top-level.R` runs the composition analyses.
By default, bootstrapped confidence intervals are disabled,
because they take a long time (several days) to compute.

### Essentia

Essentia model outputs are compiled by running
`R/1-model-perception/1-compile/src/essentia.R` within R.
Two steps are necessary first, however:

- Install the Essentia Docker image (https://hub.docker.com/r/mtgupf/essentia/);
- Modify `in_dir` and `out_dir` variables in the script
to match your current directory locations.

### MIRtoolbox

MIRtoolbox model outputs are compiled by running
`R/1-model-perception/1-compile/src/mirtoolbox` within MATLAB.
First, however, you must edit the following variables 
to match your current directory locations:

- `in_dir` - Directory containing the Bowling et al. (2018) .wav files;
- `out_dir` - Output directory;
- `pkg_path` - Directory of MIRtoolbox installation.

## Caching

Various slow operations are cached, with cached outputs saved
to the `cache` directory.
Delete this directory to clear the cache.
